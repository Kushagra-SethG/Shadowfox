# Beginner Data Visualization Task

This repository contains a beginner-level Python task focused on mastering data visualization using `matplotlib` and `pandas`. It serves as an introduction to creating and customizing basic plots, a foundational skill in data science and analytics.

---

## Objective

To understand and implement various types of data visualizations in Python using two popular libraries: `matplotlib` and `pandas`. This helps in building essential skills for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis).

---

## File Structure

- `beginners_task_.py`: Python script that includes:
  - Line Plot
  - Bar Chart
  - Histogram
  - Scatter Plot
  - Pie Chart
  - Area Chart  
  Each type is demonstrated using both `matplotlib.pyplot` and `pandas.DataFrame.plot`.

---

## Libraries Used

| Library | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Matplotlib | Core library for custom plotting |
| Pandas | Simplified plotting with dataframes |
| NumPy | Data generation and array operations |

Install them via pip if needed:
```bash
pip install matplotlib pandas numpy



#  AQI Measurement Task (Intermediate) - Data Science Domain

This repository contains an intermediate-level task aimed at analyzing and visualizing air quality index (AQI) data using Python and data science tools. It is part of the [Data Science Job Simulation Program] and focuses on real-world environmental data handling, processing, and insights extraction.

---

##  Objective

To assess air purity by collecting, preprocessing, analyzing, and visualizing air quality data from various sources. The aim is to build a foundation for understanding environmental conditions and trends through AQI.
